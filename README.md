This project is a demonstration text recognition OCR via Google Mobile Services (GMS). The sample is built with Android native Libraries to recognize in real time a text via the device Camera

The use of these Nuget Packages is mandatory to run the solution:
Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Vision
Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.AppCompat
